# Kotoamatsukami

Kotoamatsukami is an obfuscator based on LLVM-17, utilizing LLVM's new pass to implement plug-in features, for obfuscating multiple languages and platforms.

The name "Kotoamatsukami" is derived from my favorite anime, **Naruto**, which features the best genjutsu in my heart.

I will provide a complete set of related documentation in the future,now you can find the dynamically link files-Kotoamatsukami.so in /bin/build,and the /bin/test contains the different files obsfucated by different methods.

PS:This project is written by myself out of interest, it may not be complete, if you have any questions about this project, please feel free to contact me.

## Obfuscation

The following test file is rc4 encryption algorithm(source file in the end of this readme),the ida view of the original file is as follows:

Currently open obfuscation functions include:

### Loopen

A method to obfuscate control flow of the program

The performance of using Loopen only:

### branch2call

Transform the br to call some function in assembly level,curently only supported X86 and X64.

The performance of using branch2call only:

### ForObs

Add for loop for combating dynamic execution projects such as angr.

The performance of using ForObs only:

![image-20241220170303720](https://zzzcccimage1.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20241220170303720.png)

### BogusControlFlow

My bogus-control-flow is based on the version of rimao (source code: https://github.com/za233/Polaris-Obfuscator/blob/main/src/llvm/lib/Transforms/Obfuscation/BogusControlFlow2.cpp)
What i have done is to modify the judging conditions from certain to possible , but it's probability
of occurrence is so liitle that it can't happen when the actual program running .And I add a local
viriables to reinforces the illusion that it can be run.

But what I want to do is that make the false block can be real excute on a very low probability.And  if the false block have excuted ,the program will find it and re-execute the true block.But the fake variable in my false block is un-alloced so that it will corrupt.Hope I will have time to finish this in the future.

The performance of using BogusControlFlow only:

### Indirect_branch

This obfuscation method can turn the branch jump to an indirect jump through the register,and each block has a unique key to increase the difficulty crackers' attacks.

The performance of using Indirect_branch only:

![image-20241220205450343](https://zzzcccimage1.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20241220205450343.png)

### Indirect_call

As the indirect_branch method,this method will turn partial func call to indirect call through register with different keys.

The performance of using Indirect_call only:

![image-20241220205641931](https://zzzcccimage1.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20241220205641931.png)

### SplitBasicBlock

This is an easy method to split a basic block to multiple.Its purpose is to strengthen other obfuscation algorithms.

For example , the performance of using it and the Loopen:

### AddJunkCode

Add assembly level junk code , currently only support X86 and X64.
The performance of using AddJunkCode only:

![image-20241220164639032](https://zzzcccimage1.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20241220164639032.png)

### Flatten

This code is adapted from the Pluto project (https://github.com/DreamSoule/ollvm17)
Thanks to the contributions of our predecessors!
The performance of using Flatten only:

![image-20241220211100256](https://zzzcccimage1.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20241220211100256.png)

### Substitution

This code is adapted from the Pluto project (https://github.com/bluesadi/Pluto)
source file: https://github.com/bluesadi/Pluto/blob/kanxue/Transforms/src/Substitution.cpp
I just adapted it to the LLVM-17 and the LLVM New Pass
Thanks to the contributions of our predecessors!
The performance of using Substitution only:

![image-20241220210934072](https://zzzcccimage1.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20241220210934072.png)

### GVEncrypt

The method will encrypt partial global virable or global constant with inserting the func-relative dec func in the head of the func,and guard the dec func only excute once through a global virable.May I will add the relative func in the end of the func to enhance secrecy.

The performance of using GVEncrypt only:

![image-20241220212030685](https://zzzcccimage1.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20241220212030685.png)

### AntiDebug

The method will insert some anti-debugging functions into the program's constructor list to be called when the program starts running:
And I try to make the anti-debugging functions configurable,see code for details.

The performance of using AntiDebug only:

![image-20241220214513409](https://zzzcccimage1.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20241220214513409.png)

## How to install

You can compile LLVM-17 project in by youself in your computer,then modify the CMakeLists.txt of this project to compile it.

The following are the commands I use for your reference:

```
git clone --depth 1 -b release/17.x https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
mkdir build
cmake -G Ninja -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;ARM;AArch64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON -DLLVM_OBFUSCATION_LINK_INTO_TOOLS=
ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./build/ ../llvm-project/llvm
ninja -j8
ninja install
```

These commands will install compiled products to <your-llvmdir>/build,then your need modify the CMakeLists.txt of this project.

```
cd Kotoamatsukami
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

 finish ~~

### How to use

You need set the configuration file in `/tmp/Kotoamatsukami/Kotoamatsukami.config`,which format is as follows.

**`0`**: All functions are turned off (everything is disabled).

**`1`**: All functions are turned on (everything is enabled).

**`2`**: Enable only the functions that are already enabled (keep the enabled functions on, others unchanged).

**`3`**: Enable all functions except those that are explicitly disabled (enable all functions that are not disabled).

Then you can use the Kotoamatsukami.so as follows:

```shell
<your-clang-17> -fpass-plugin=<your-Kotoamatsukami_so>
```

`Kotoamatsukami.config`

```json
