# Kotoamatsukami

Kotoamatsukami is an obfuscator based on LLVM-17, utilizing LLVM's new pass to implement plug-in features, for obfuscating multiple languages and platforms.

The name "Kotoamatsukami" is derived from my favorite anime, *Naruto*, which features the best genjutsu in my heart.

I will provide a complete set of related documentation in the future.
